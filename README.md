# challenge-12-employee-tracker

## Description
 
 In this weeks challenge I was tasked to create a employee tracker application. This application allows a user to use the employee database to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees within a company and stay organized. This application is a command-line application, and when the application is started the user is presented with a main menu with several choices. The user is presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add department, add role, add employee, update employee role, update an employee manager, view employee by manager, delete department, delete role, delete employee, view budget salary within a deparment, and they have the option to quit/ exit out of the main menu. When the user chooses view all departments, they are presented a table with all the departments. When the user chooses view all roles they are presented with a table with all the roles. When the user chooses view all employees, they are presented with a table of all the employees in that company.When the user chooses add a department, they are prompted with a series of required questions to answer to be able to add that department to the database. When the user chooses add a role, they are then prompted with a series of required questions to answer to be able to add that role to the database. When the user chooses add an employee, they are presented with a series of required questions to answer to be able to add that employee to the database. When the user chooses update an emplyee role, they user is asked what employee they would like to update and some more detailed questions to be able to update that employee's role. A similar process happens when the user chooses update employee manager. The user is also able to view all the employees that have the same manager that they report to, and the user is presented with a table of those employees. The user is also able to choose if they would like to delete a department, role, or an employee. When they do that, and they will find that whatever they deleted will not show up in their database. They user is able to view each department salary, and they will be presented with a table of the salary budget for whatever department they choose to view. Lastly, when the user chooses quit, the terminal will exit them out of the main menu.
